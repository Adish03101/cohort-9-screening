In this task, I used the inbuit grover's search algorithm for mutiple targets of qiskit from Qiskit version used was 1.0.2 to search for the postions in the list which were smaller than the given no.



#No. qubits used
The maximum no. of qubits used would be defined by the length of the list. Even if the list has large numbers, the max no. of qubits would be small if the no. of elements in the list is small



#End notes
Another method thought was to find a matrix which if mutiplied by the binary representation of the desired no. would automatically give all the postions of the no. less than the given no..  This method would be feasible if I could make the matrix a unitary as any unitary matrix can be made using rotation gates. Making a unitary matrix was challenging and am still searching for methods to do so.
